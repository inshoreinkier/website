## Measure of Location
Measures of location describe the central tendency of the data. They include: 

- Mean
- Median
- Mode

### The Mean
The means as known as average of the observations.

There is a distinguish between Population Mean & Sample Mean:

The problem with 'The Mean' is being sensitive on small setts. For example: 

- Set 1: (2, 4, 6, 20) --> The Mean: 32 / 4 = 8
- Set 2: (2, 4, 6, 100) --> The Mean: 112 / 4 = 28

As it seen, in small samples / setts the mean may changed extremely. This situation goes us to 'The Median'

## The Median
The median is the middle number in sett / sample when numbers ordered by ascending.

**Example**

- Sample: (12, 5, 7, 1, 25) --> The Median: 7 --> (1, 5, ==7==, 12, 25)

### The Mode
The mode tells us that which number in sample is repeated most. 

>[!important]
> If there are tie repeated numbers, then there is no mode.

## Measure of Dispersion
Measures of dispersion describe the spread of the data. The include:

- Range
- Inter Quartile Range
- The Standard Deviation & Variance

### The Range
The range is the difference between smallest number and largest number in sample. 

$$ The Range = Largest Number - Smallest Number $$

### The Inter Quartile Range
The Interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the first quartile and the third quartile.

$$ IQR = Q3 - Q1 $$

IQR helps not to effected by outliers. Outliers numbers may changes the result depends on differences between them. As a result, it avoid to see healthy predictions.

## The Standart Deviation & Variance

These two metrics aims that how much far away values from median. Variance and The Standart Deviation are the same things almost, the different is that one of them squared unit the other one is same unit as data set.
