**Taylor's Objectives:**

- **Standardization:** Making process standart with dividing jobs to separate to small parts. That increased to adaptation time, make it achievable for almost everyone. 
- **Efficiency:** Reducing unnecessary part to increase efficiency
- **Discipline:** To control the system/process, created hierarchical authority.

## Pre-Assembly Line Period

- Time was mostly spending by carrying tools, materials for transportation.
- Needed skilled labors to produce goods.
- Being needed skilled labors makes skilled workers inexpugnable in a condition. Because they could find another job easily in Detroit.
- Skilled mechanics, worker was searching their tools, materials most of time while working. That was waste of time for production.

## First Division of Labor

- Skilled mechanics stoped to handle with small task. Unskilled labor created to handle those small task instead of them. 
- Skilled workers was focusing only their professions.

## Further Division

- Unskilled labor become a stock handler. They started to specialized in their jobs. 
- Assembly teams (unskilled labor) divided in their-self in time. Pop up new specialization areas in assembly teams.

>[!note]
>No needed for skilled workers: for other technological developments made possible to produce parts with such precision that one was exactly like the other.

## Fordist Productions' Principles

- Arrange work in departments
-  Rearranging Transportation Tasks
	- All tasks location re-arranged. Similar task gather in a same/close place. No need to walk around anymore.
	- Workers has spots, they were working in their spots. Subtracted unnecessary walk-around.
- Assembly Stations(?)
	- Ford workers were specialized on a job.

In conclusion, Ford achieved that He can control workers based on his desired or working style. Before that, Ford was needed skilled workers to produce goods. Producing goods process didn't design as able to by standart labor force, but Ford break it and have voice about them.

>Assembly line eliminated the time consuming task of bringing parts to the car; instead the cars were brought to the workers.

>Increased division of labor allowed workers to increase their productivity by repeating one small task time and time again.

## Ford's Assembly Line

- Decreased need of skilled labors.
- Production process could more handler with less specialized labor.
- It increased of production speed. Avoiding waste of time

## Summarize of The Assembly System

- Workers actions are minimized and avoided by unnecessary movement to increase efficiency.
- Transportation handled by machines. Workers main responsibility was not carrying materials.
- Skilled labor needs decreased, workers focus on only one thing. That makes people specialized in their jobs short term.

**Mass Production:** the organizational technology based on competences in using standardized, progressive assembly process to manufacture goods

## Fordism

Fordism is next generation of Taylorism. Increasing efficiency, time, energy and money. Main point are:

- Efficient
- Predictable (Standardization)
- Control over Labor

**Why Fordism was Efficient?**

- They focus on their main job not other small task or unnecessary things. "The less people had to move, the faster they would work" - Henry Ford
- Assembly Line. Workers have spots and they don't need to move.
- Minimum transportation materials. Workers don't carry materials to somewhere anymore mostly.

**Why Fordism was Predictable & Controllable?**

- Workers was watching by supervisor or management to testing them.
- Inspection Department created for AR-GE about the system.
- "Predetermined speed of conveyors along the assembly line to control the working pace of their employees"

## Assembly Line Worker

- Deskilled
- Not Involved in the Decision Making
- Replaceable

## Summarize of Mass Production

**The Guiding Principle:** Automation of production process.

**Them Aim:**

- As much as possible separate the process to small and simple parts.
- More Automated factories
- Fewer and less skilled workers

## Why Fordism an -ism?

Fordism is a system, a paradigm that dominated the world for longer than half a century.

- Mass Production & Mass Consumption (The Wage-Labour Nexus)
- Large Corporations, Hierarchies, Bureaucracies emerged
- **The Fordist Welfare State:**
	- Creating opportunities for workers as economically. Like new middle class, workers class. 

>"I will build a motorcar for the great multitudes, constructed of the best materials by the best men and women to be hired. Any person making a good salary will be able to own one. And enjoy, with his family, the blessings of hours of pleasure in God's great open spaces"
>\- Henry Ford

## Family As a Unit of Consumption

Domestic system decreased and replaced by factory system. As a result, family organization, their life changed.

- All family members was working. After that, Only father of family members was working in factory. Women was at home handling with chores, children were going to schools.

This changing changed European family system. They were a unit of production and consumption but now they are only unit of consumption. (?)

## Ford's New Program

Ford's workers were not happy. They were dissatisfied. As a result, workers were quit their jobs. That cause to increase turnover and absenteeism. This situation was a big problem for Ford because It was costly. To solve this issue he came up with three components:

- 8 Hour Work Day: Who loves to work many hours in a hard job and getting poor salary, right? 
- Increased salaries to $5 (It was an incredible amount at the time)
	- Regular Wage: $2.34
	- Profit Sharing Amount: $2.66 (Condition: Living based on [[#Ford's Assumptions]])
- Set up a Saving & Loans Fund for Workers: Basically, It's a bank. 

## Ford's Assumptions

- Home environment can affect of efficiency. Fords tried altering the bad habit and behaviors with extra money.
- Making workers consumer too. They shouldn't be only unit of a production also include the consumption part. If they have enough money, they could buy a new Ford card.
- It hopefully would make workers less inclined to organize and join a union.

## The Wage-Labour Nexus

- **Taylorian**
	- when the organisation of work enables mass production, without this profoundly modifying the life style of employees.
	- For Taylor: worker is an economic animal.
- **Fordist**
	- Which combines the development of consumption norms and production norms
		- For Ford: my workers is my consumer.
