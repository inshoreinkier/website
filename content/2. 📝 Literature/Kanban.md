## Boards

Kanban boards gives an opportunity to visualize yor project management process. Also, it brings several advantages to maximize efficiency, reduce bottleneck and multi-tasking. 

### Elements of a Kanban Board

Kanban boards discuss on 5 part: 

- Visual Signals: Defined work cards
- Columns: Represents "Workflow"
- WIP (Work In Progress) Limits: Preventing overload
- Commitment Point: Backlog, To-Do column
 Delivery Point: Done column, Finished works.

## WIP (Work In Progress) Limits

WIP Limits prevent of work 'nearly done' and overload. Also, it make it visible to blockers and bottlenecks. As result, teams or managers have a clear vision what makes it slower the project or which things cause of inefficiency. 

## Kanban Cards

Kanban cards are visualized of a task (issue) with summary, category, label, etc. It helps to follow of process the task visually on the board.
