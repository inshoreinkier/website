## Overview

Scrum is project/software development management framework. It's a continuesly cycle which has dead line. The team all the time in communacation with daily, weekly meetings. Team make an analysis the scrum end of the period. As a result, It's also a continuesly learning process for the team.

### Memebers of Scrum Team

Scrum teams taking shape with 3 main part:

- **Product Owner:** He/She is the bridge between business unit, customer and marketing needs. 
- **The Scrum Master / Coach:** It's goal is increasing or stabilize the efficieny in scrum and team. He/She coaches to team. 
- **Development Team:** The workers, labours and also shot caller for backlogs' deadline and velocities. 

### Scrum Artifacts

Those are important information used by the scrum team that helps define the product and what work to be done to create the product. There are 3 artifacts in scrum:

- **Product Backlog:** The demand or jobs which has to be done. It  created by Product Owner or Product Manager.
- **Sprint Backlog:** Selected demands, jobs, to-dos' for the during scrum sprint. It selected begining of sprint on 'Sprint Planning' meeting.
- **Increment:** Definition of 'Done' and sprint goals. Teams may use different word to descripe to 'Done'

### Scrum Ceremonies / Events

Scrum is continuesly cycle which has a deadline. As a result, there are routine meetings, practices and ceremonies. Those are:

 1. Organize the Backlog 
 2. Sprint Planning 
 3. Sprint
 4. Daily Scrum / Stand Up (Daily Meetings)
 5. Sprint Review
 6. Sprint Retrospective

## Sprints

Sprints are periods which have end date to deliver product/software packages. Team choose issues before start Sprints. After that, issues tried to completed in sprints. Sprint duration may change based on project or manager.

## Sprint Planning

Before start to sprint, team has to decide what are they going to do, and how are going to achieve their goals.

- **The What:** The [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/PO - Product Owner]] sets the goal for that sprint and the team argues how can they achieve the goal. 
- **The How:** Developers decides to the path goings to the goal while being touch with [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/PO - Product Owner]].
- **The Who:** [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/PO - Product Owner]] and development team has to attend [[Sprint Planning]] meetings. Otherwise, it's impossible to start sprint because [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/PO - Product Owner]] will decide the goal and development team argue that is it possible to achieve this goal or how can we do it. 
- **The Inputs:** What is the difference between 'The What' & 'The Inputs'? I didn't understand this part.
- **The Outputs:** Announcing the goals, backlogs and describing how it will work done. 

![A diagram showing the inputs into sprint planning, the goals of the meeting, and the outputs](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:d898416a-7850-4cb8-a283-915a1f377ad6/sprint%20planning%20diagram.svg?cdnVersion=1224)

Sprint planning needs to estimate based on technic knowledge and experience. It should be clarified which backlogs/inputs can be done or not in time. 

> Scrum is a process framework aimed at solving complex problems. Complex problems require an empirical process (learning by doing). Empirical processes are very hard to plan, so donâ€™t kid yourself--you canâ€™t build the perfect plan.

## Ceremonies

Those ceremonies build up the skeleton of Scrum. Team members, [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/PO - Product Owner]], etc. gets update and feedback instantly with daily meeting, weekly meeting etc. The main point is that being in communicate instantly. Several ceremonies like those:

#### Sprint Planning

Planing which product, request will delivered in this sprint. 

- **Attendees:** Development team, [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/Scrum Master]], [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/PO - Product Owner]]
- **When:** At the beginning of a sprint.
- **Agile framework:** Scrum
- **Purpose:** Making clear items of work and deciding the path which carry to success. 

#### Daily Stand-Up

As known as 'Daily Scrum' is a short, 15-20 minute (or less) daily meetings.

- **Attendees:** Development team, [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/Scrum Master]], [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/PO - Product Owner]]
- **When:** Everyday
- **Duration:** 15-20 minute
- **Purpose:** To inform everyone, what's going on. Also, getting feedback that is there any problem. Therefore, meeting cover up with these 3 questions:
	- What did I complete yesterday?
	- Am I blocked by anything?
	- What will I work on today?

#### Sprint Review

The 'Sprint Review' also called an 'Iteration Review'. In Sprint review meetings, talks about what we have done or what we couldn't done also team members share their feedbacks, experience which they gained during current sprint. 

- **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner.
- **When:** At the end of sprint.
- **Duration:** 45 minutes per week of iteration.
- **Agile Framework:** Scrum & Kanban
- **Purpose:** It's showcase your products to stakeholders. Getting mutual feedbacks during meetings. 

#### Sprint Retrospective

Sprint Retrospective meetings include team members not stakeholders like 'Sprint Review'. Team analyze their-self, their performance and problems which come up during sprint. They focus on what can we do it better, what can we improve. 

- **Attendees:** Development team, scrum master, product owner.
- **When:** At the end of sprint.
- **Duration:** 90 minutes per week of iteration.
- **Agile Framework:** Scrum & Kanban
- **Purpose:** Learn to what worked well and what didn't during sprint.

## Backlogs

Backlogs are list of works. It prepares by [[1. ðŸ“© Permanent/PO - Product Owner]] or business units. Backlogs come from customer, request and demands. Backlogs doesn't push to developers, developers pick backlogs. 

#### Start with The Two "R"s

A team's 'roadmap' and 'requirements' provide the foundation for the product backlog.

- Roadmap
	- Epics
		- Requirements & User Stories

## Sprint Reviews

Sprint reviews are the answer of what we have done, what was the strength and weak sides. It has not to be formal meetings. Only team members attend those meetings usually.

### Definition of Done (DoD)

It should clarified that when we can put an issue card to 'Done' columns. It helps to avoid miss understands and unfinished issues. 

### Culture of Delivery

Successful teams clarified process, develop steps in each work items to prevent delivering miss or incorrect packages based on those questions: 

- Did issues, stories well-written by the team before implementation? 
- Does everyone knows team' engineering values and culture?
- Does everyone commitment about develop process?

## Stand-ups 

Stand-ups as known as 'Daily Scrums' too. It is a short daily meeting talks everyone about:

- What did I done yesterday?
- Is there are any impediment which blocks to move? 
- What will I do today? 

## Scrum Master

Scrum master is play maker of Scrum. Scrum master aim those:

- Increase of efficiency of Scrum
- Create rules based on project or specific needs which adapting the firm culture, vision. 
- Solving impediment issues

Scrum master can't always follow the books, standart techniques. Every project, firm may have different needs and culture. Scrum master needs to adapt those and change the games rule with maximizing efficiency. !

**Purposes:**

- Clarified block issues, mistakes and weak sides of the sprint.
- Create opportunities for strength sides.

- Get feedback, comments about sprint, team and project.

It's a great chance to tell your opinions about sprint, team, etc. because only attends to team members. You don't need worry about consumers, big bosses.

- **The Who:** All team members.

### Roles

Therefore, teams can perform their-self and increase their efficiency and improve them capabilities. Also, scrum metrics allows to make decisions based on data. As a result, managers, teams make their decisions with logic.

- ROI (Return on Investment)
- Customer satisfaction
- Team Satisfaction

### Team Velocity

Team velocity graphs represent team's delivered work of items in sprint. That makes to calculate that how much backlogs the team can handle. As a result, teams' volumes become predictable. Also, it can watch is there something unusual about teams' performance.
