# [[2. 📝 Literature/BUS 231 - W9 - Marx's Critique of Capitalism & Braverman's Critique of Taylorism]]
#literature, #edu , #management 

## Industrial Management Philosophy

- Main concern is that who is going to will set standards
- Controlling in every step of process to increase efficiency
- Productivity focused
- Management become a work. It has own specialization
- New job roles: supervisor, managers, etc.
- Work doesn't need special abilities, ==Deskilled==

## Advantages of Taylorism

- Worker is a factor of production like a machine. (Economic animal)
- Focus on individual worker, no recognition of collectivity. (You get pay based on how much worked)
- Fragmentation Tasks --> Efficiency

In Taylorism, people motivated by money, they were ==rational man==. (It was not completely true in real life.)

## Critical Approaches to Taylorism

**Taylorism & Fordism**
- Ignored the human factor.
- Removed 'the social' from human beings

## Braverman's Critique of Taylorism

Braver-man argued that capitalist organize try to minimize the cost and maximize the productivity.

### Deskilling

- Deskilling removed the skills, knowledge. 
- Securing managerial control over the labour process.
- Finding a new employee for the job easier than normal. Replaceable worker.

## Further Problems with Scientific Management

- Employee can't get share of cake. Stakeholders only affected positively on extra gains. Employees just get their salaries and extra pays.
- Specialized jobs became boring.
- Workers under-perform versus to machines. Machines > Employee
- Missing parts: task significance, autonomy, variety and feedback.

## Taylorism - Further Limitations

- Scientific management was not most effective way of organizing work because it was less suitable for high quality products.
- Ignored psychologic side of human.
- Management seen as all-powreful

## Alienation

- Employee can't connect them to their firms big picture, goals or etc. 

**Marx on Capitalism & Alienation**
- The man produce more, get pay lower than he produced. This situation is profitable for the rich, but it's really bad for poor people.
- Machines supplant to worker with their performance, efficiencies. As a result, workers became machines too. Also that situation affect to alienation.
- The worker has limited autonomy over the labor process.
- Worker can't control the assembly line, final product, organizational goals.

**Aspects to Alienation**
- The process of production
- The object of labor
- Oneself
- Fellow Human Beings

### Aspects of Alienation in Work

- Work Process: Workers don't have control on the work process
- Creativity removed, worker just do their task
- Producing for someone else and they don't have control about the final product.
- Workers work based on rules, standards. They are not free
- Labour becomes a commodity. (Sold in the marketplace)
- Workers took away from community, groups.

### Effect of Alienation in Work

- Dehumanisation: a mere cog in a machine #new-word 
- Meaninglessness: Do it the task, no more creativity, no more social work environment
- Powerlessness: just a little or no permission about how works done
	- Wage Slaves

## The Henry Ford of Heart Surgery

**The Fundamental of Fordism**
- Higher volume: Decrease cost, Increase productivity
- Every task is rationalized

## Marx's Critique of Capitalism

- Human may enjoy work on some conditions:
	- If he/she is free to work
	- If he/she is creative, and his/her job is not boring
	- if someone else does not reap all the benefits

- Capitalist society shown to fail to live up to its own ideals
	- Inequalities > gap between rich and poor

- Capitalist society confronted with its own ideals
	- Freedom, choice, democratic participation, equality etc.

## Commodity Fetishism

- Human enslaved by something they have made
	- People make goods for sale
	- Commodities come to control their makers
	- The economy controls workers & capitalists
	- They economy seems unstoppable and totally out of control
