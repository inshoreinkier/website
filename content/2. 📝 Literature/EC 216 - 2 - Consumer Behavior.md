There is a similar paradigma with economics 101 that =='How can you purchase good with limited income?'==

**Consumer Theory**
- Consumer Preferences
- Budget Constraints
- Consumers Choices

>[!important] Theory of Consumer Behavior
> 
> The theory begins with those assumptions:
> - **Completeness:** Consumer can compare and rank all the basket between them.
> - **Transitivity**: Consumer prefer A basket over to B basket and B basket prefer over to C basket. Therefore, A basket prefer over C basket too. Example: A > B & B > C = A > B > C
> - **More is Better Than Less:** Consumers all ways want to more for their profit.

Economist developed models to understand consumer behaviors, it's called 'Behavioral Economics'

## Consumer Preferences

**Market Basket (Bundle):** It represent total of goods in basket.
**Indifference Curves:** It represents all combination of market baskets that provide a consumer with the same level of satisfaction.
**Indifference Maps:** Set of indifference curves.
	- Indifference curves cannot intersect.
**Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS):** It's graph shows that consumer how much willing to sacrifice an good to another.
**Perfect Substitutes:** Two good for which the marginal rate of substitution of one for the other is a constant.
	- Example: A person may get same satisfaction apple and orange.
**Perfect Complements:** Two goods for which the MRS is zero / infinite.
	- Example: Consumer don't want to get one more left shoes without getting right shoes because it would useless. 
**BADS:** Less of them is preferred to more. (Air pollution)
**Utility:** Numerical score which represent of consumer satisfaction.
**Utility Functions:** Formula that assigns a level of utility to individual market baskets. Simply way of comparing baskets between them.
**Ordinal Utility Function:** Generates a ranking of market baskets in order of most to least preferred.
**Cardinal Utility Function:** Utility function describing by how much one market basket is preferred to another.

## Budget Constraints

**Budget Constraints:** Consumer faces with unlimited wants vs limited resource which is limited income. 
**Budget Line:** All combination of baskets equals to same total spending.
**Income Changes:** The vertical intercept of the budget line but does not change the slope.
**Price Changes:** The slope changes.

## Consumer Choice

We assume that consumer make decisions rational. Therefore, ==maximize the satisfaction they can achieve, given the limited budged available to them.==

The maximizing market basket must satisfy two conditions:
- It must be located on the budget line
- It must give the consumer the most preferred combination of goods and services.

**Marginal Benefit:** Benefit from the consumption of one additional unit of a good.
**Marginal Cost:** Cost of one additional unit of a good. 
**Corner Solutions:** People may have special desires. Therefore, their satisfaction may not suit with general formulas. ==When a corner solution arises, the consumer's MRS does not necessarily equal the price ratio.==

## Revealed Preference

>If a consumer chooses one market basket over another, and if the chosen market basket is more expensive than the alternative, then the consumer must prefer the chosen market basket.

## Marginal Utility & Consumer Choice

- [ ] constraint #new-word 

**Marginal Utility (MU):** Additional satisfaction obtained from consuming one additional unit of a good. 
**Diminishing Marginal Utility:** 
**Ration:**

## Cost of Living Indexes

Cost of living index as known as 'Consumer Price Index (CPI)'
