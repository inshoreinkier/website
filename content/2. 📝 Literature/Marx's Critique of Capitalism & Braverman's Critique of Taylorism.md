# Pre-Industrialization Era

The traditional shop system was doing almost everything own by own. Worker has to pay attention to production process that means life-long learning process. A person can't be good in every profession. Person has lack of knowledge or abilities on some areas. Therefore, producing a good was slow and hard in pre-industrialization era.

# Industrial Management Philosophy

- The main concern is who is going to set the standards and the pace of the work.
- The tenet is that pace of work determines the productivity of the work.
- Emerging management class needs to information as much as workers. 
- Knowledge of production controls every steps in labor process.

- A new professions came up like supervisor, managers, etc. Those are control organization, workers. 
- Direct producers became deskilled
- Direct producers lost their control on production process. They are stripped of knowledge of how production is organised.

## Where Do We Come Here From? 

The answer is scientific management and mass production. Taylorism and Fordism opened of this road by:

- Low Skilled
- Disposable
- Fragmented
- Closely Supervised

## Advantages & Drawbacks of Taylorism

- Taylorism separate jobs to small parts to increase efficiency and speed up production process.
- Taylorism sees people as economical animal. They have value as much as machines.
- Taylorism focus on individual, not the big picture. While exploiting, it doesn't care the result. It just care the profit and efficiency.
- Self-sufficient company.
- Argues that increasing fragmentation of tasks proved to be conducive to efficient manufacturing of high volume - low cost products.

## Critical Approaches to Taylorism

Both of them ignores the human and their emotions. They think people like a machine, or just motivating by money etc. Further that, people are emotional, social living creatures. Also, they took their skills. This scientific management make them de skilled. 

## Braveman's Critique of Taylorism

Bravermann argues that capitalist organizes focus on minimizing cost and maximizing efficiency. Thus, people lost their control their skills, abilities on works and more the point is that they don't have knowledge about assembly line, process of production. Workers deskilled in this times. 

## Further Problems with Scientific Management

- Employees don't share the profit. They just get their salary.
- Specialized jobs in mass production are became boring. They are doing only a few simple task in every day. 

## Alienation

Capitalism doesn't give autonomy to workers. On the other hand, capitalism limited workers' right to speak about jobs. They became deskilled employees, they can fire easily and find another person instead of them. Thus, workers does not:

- Own the means of production
- Control the process or the pace
- Own the final product
- Set the organizational goals
- Have the right to make decisions

**There are four aspect to alienation**
Workers is alienated from:

- The process of production
- The object of labor
- Oneself
- Fellow human beings
