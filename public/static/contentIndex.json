Agile is not a system, or it does not follow rules. It’s just a manifesto. It has an own philosophy and manifesto, but mainly it’s about the process and focus on product/software.\nAgile Manifesto §\nAgile manifesto came up from 17 person, meeting about software development. At that time, There were some problems or issues which was blocking efficieny of development. Therefore, they bringed together and came up with ‘Agile Manifesto’:\n\nOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.\nSimplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.\n\nAgile is not new invantion or principless which people don’t know. People, companies was using those similar metholodgies or follow principles own by own.

Because they could find another job easily in Detroit.\nSkilled mechanics, worker was searching their tools, materials most of time while working. That was waste of time for production.\n\nFirst Division of Labor §\n\nSkilled mechanics stoped to handle with small task. Unskilled labor created to handle those small task instead of them.\nSkilled workers was focusing only their professions.\n\nFurther Division §\n\nUnskilled labor become a stock handler. They started to specialized in their jobs.\nAssembly teams (unskilled labor) divided in their-self in time. Pop up new specialization areas in assembly teams.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nNo needed for skilled workers: for other technological developments made possible to produce parts with such precision that one was exactly like the other.\n\nFordist Productions’ Principles §\n\nArrange work in departments\nRearranging Transportation Tasks\n\nAll tasks location re-arranged.

They were a unit of production and consumption but now they are only unit of consumption. (?)\nFord’s New Program §\nFord’s workers were not happy. They were dissatisfied. As a result, workers were quit their jobs. That cause to increase turnover and absenteeism. This situation was a big problem for Ford because It was costly. To solve this issue he came up with three components:\n\n8 Hour Work Day: Who loves to work many hours in a hard job and getting poor salary, right?\nIncreased salaries to $5 (It was an incredible amount at the time)\n\nRegular Wage: $2.34\nProfit Sharing Amount: $2.66 (Condition: Living based on Ford’s Assumptions)\n\n\nSet up a Saving &amp; Loans Fund for Workers: Basically, It’s a bank.\n\nFord’s Assumptions §\n\nHome environment can affect of efficiency.

Kendi geçimini gemi seyahatlerinden kazanıyor. Becerikli, kuvvetli bir o kadar da çekici biri olan Martin Eden’ın macerası denizlerde değil karada geçiyor. Tahmin edilebileceği üzere onu karaya bağlayan unsur: Aşk. Yaşadığı çete ve varoş hayatı esnasında bir kızla tanışır. Kızla tanışmasıyla birlikte tüm kaderi yeniden ilmek ilmek dokunur, daha doğrusu kendisi dokumaya başlar. Başta çevresindekiler olmak üzere, hayatta dahil bunun ihtimal dahilinde olmadığını hatta olamayacağını söyler. Peki, kahramanımız buna kulak asar mı? Tabiki de hayır!\nMartinin aşık olduğu kız, Ruth, bir burjuvazi ailenin mensubudur ve edebiyat fakültesine gitmektedir. Bir akşam yemeğinde onunla karşılaşan Martin ilk görüşte aşık olmuştur. İlk anda hislerini anlamlandıramasa da sonradan anlıyor olacak ki, aşık olmuştu. Ama aşkının yanında başka bir his daha vardı, onu rahatsız eden bir takım şeyler. Çünkü hayatı boyunca hiç bir burjuvazilerle bir araya gelmemiş hatta bir sofraya oturup çatal, bıçak ile yemek yememiş. Ne yapacağını bilemeyen kahramanız çaresizlik içinde çabalarken bir yanda da ilk defa tanıklık ettiği soylu insanlara hayran olmuş bir vaziyette bakıyordu. Onları yarı tanrı olarak atfediyordu. Gerçi çok geçmeden aslında onların ne kadar ahmak olduğunu, papağan gibi sadece belli başlı kalıpları tekrar ettiğini öğrenecekti ve bundan tiksinecekti.\nMartin Eden’ın soylu bir aile ile tanışması kendisinin ne kadar cahil ve kaba birisi olduğunu gösterdi. Bu durum geçmişten gelen kitap okuma, öğrenme aşkını kamçıladı. Tabi ana etken aşkı olan, Ruth idi.\nLogs §\nMartin üst sınıf olarak atfettiği kıza, Arthur’a aşık olmuş durumda. Bu sınıf farkı ve geçmişinin getirdiği farklılıkları kızla arasında bir sorunmuş gibi görüyor. Bu sorunları düzeltmek için yola koyulmuş gibi gözüküyor. Tabi bu esnada yaşadığı rutin hayatı ona daha farklı geliyor ve çevresinde olan bitenleri yorumlayıp arada ki farkı anlamlandırmaya çalışıyor.\nMartin’in kızlar üzerinden etki bıraktığını ve birçok kızın ondan etkilendiği söyleniyor. Martin Eden ise bunun sadece onları çok önemsemediğinden, umursamadığından kaynaklı olduğunu söylüyor. Keza haklılık payı olduğunu düşünüyorum. Genel anlamda insanları çok umursayıp, değer vermemek gerekiyor. Kendi kendine var olabilmek ve kendinle vakit geçirebiliyor olmak başlıca etkileyici unsurlar. Birçok insan bunları başaramadığı için gıptayla bakılan bir insan olabiliyorsunuz. Tabi bunun yanında kişinin kendine has karakterinin, jargonun, stilinin olması da çok önemli.\nMartin kıza yakışır birisi olabilmek için kütüphaneye gidip kendini entellektüel anlamda yetiştirmeye başladı. Geçmişinden gelen eksik bilgiler ve kültürden dolayı hayli zorlansa da bir şekilde başa çıkıyor. Motivasyonu sadece kız değil aynı zamanda daha iyi biri olacağını düşünüyor. Kız giderse en azından bilgili, kültürlü ve daha saygın bir insan olurum falan filan. Benim gözlemlediğim unsur ise kendi karakterini, tabiatını sevdiği kız uğruna değiştirmeye başladığı. Pozitif yönde olsa da bu değişim, değer mi? Veyahut bu değişimin olması için bu denli sevebileceğimiz, aşık olabileceğimiz bir kadın mı olmalı hayatımızda? Neden kendi kendine değil de bir kız uğruna bunu yapıyor. Bu gelişimin bu eylemlerin merkez noktasına kızı koydu. İlerleyen sayfalarda o merkez noktası gittiğinde Martin Eden’da yörüngede kopup, sapıp gidecek.\nBaya sayfa ilerledim yazılabilecek onca şey birikti ama özet bir şekilde yazmak istiyorum. Genel anlamda bizim eleman, Martin Eden, tam anlamıyla değişmeye başladı diyebiliriz. Tabi arkasından gelen geçmişi, alışkanlıkları onun peşini hiçbir zaman bırakmayacak bundan emin olabiliriz ama yeni bir hayata da adım attığını da söyleyebiliriz. Kıza olan aşkından dolayı onu yarı-tanrı motif haline getirdi veyahut erişilemeyecek bir konum koydu. Bunun büyüsü okuduğum son sayfalarda kayboldu bizim elemanın gözünde. İlerleyen sayfalarda nasıl reaksiyon verecek göreceğiz. Benim gözlemlediğim bir unsur şu: Kız Martini kendi kalıplarına, ideallerine sokmak istiyor. Onu olduğu gibi kabul etmektense kendi doğrularına, zevklerine göre eğip bükmeyi tercih ediyor. Keza bu durumu bencillik ve egoistlik olarak yorumluyorum. İnsanları olduğu kabul etmek gerekiyor. Nüansı kaçırmamak adına belirtmek isterim ki, yapılan hatalardan, yanlışlardan, nezaketsizlikten veya sorumsuzca davranışlardan bahsetmiyorum. Bu yüzden Ruth’a, kıza bir tık önyargım gelişmeye başladı diyebilirim. Yalnız bizim oğlanda sağlam çıktı durmadan kızın peşinde, aralıksız ders mers çalışıp dininiyor. Bakalım nereye gidecek hikaye. (Tahminime göre kız zihinsel sorunlar yaratıp bunu piç gibi ortada bırakacak.)\nKitabın arka kısmını okuyunca aklıma geldi, Jack London kitap aracılığıyla sınıfsal farklara dikkat çekiyor. Martin Eden’in çevresindeki insanları, geçmişini süzerken veya değerlendirirken bunu çok net görebiliyoruz. Ruth, yani soylu kızsa dünyadan neler olup bittiğinden haberinin olmadığını sadece kendi yarattıkları dünyada ki zevklerden, olaylardan ibaret olduğunu sanıyor. Bu sınıfsal çatışmanın çözümünü ortak yaşam alanları ve sosyal olanakların yaratılmasından geçeceğini düşünüyorum. Bu durumu tezgahtar olarak çalışırken de yaşamıştım. İnsan görmediği, hissetmedi, yaşamadığı, duymadığı şeyleri fark edemeyebiliyor.\nMartin son gaz çalışmalarına, kitap okumalarına ve en önemlisi yazmalarına devam ediyor. Bu esnada git gide okuduğu kitaplar, öğretilere de bağlanmaya başlıyor. Tabi Ruth’a olan aşkını da unutmamız lazım. Yazdığı hikayeleri, denemeleri dergilere gönderiyor yayınlamaları için ama hepsinden ret yiyor. Çünkü kendisi farkında olmasa da hala çok körpe, amatör ve bilgisiz. Ruth’a hissettiği aşk ve kendi içerisinde kopan fırtınadan dolayı bunları göremiyor ve çok iyi şeyler yazdığını zannediyor. Acı gerçekle ilerleyen sayfalarda yüzleşip bir isyan, bir sorgulama dönemi gelecektir kesin. Velhasılıkelam, Ruth’da Martin’i olması istediği kişi haline getirmeye çalışıyor. Bunu direkt olarak değil, gizlice veya sinsice usul usul yapmaya çalışıyor. Kendi fantezilerinin gerçekleşmesi uğruna onu seven bir insanın sevdiği yoldan değil de onun tercih ettiği yoldan gitmesini istiyor. Bu durumu çok iyi bir şekilde ifade edemiyor. Çok uzun bir süre üzerinde düşünüp kıvrandıktan sonra anlatabilirim belki ama beni kopartıyor bu durum o ayrı.\nDüzenli olarak kitabı okdumadığım için ve okuduktan hemen sonra bunları yazmadığım için belli başlı tutarsızlıklar, boşluklar ortaya çıkabilir. Velhasılıkelam, Martin’in parası biti diye hatırlıyorum. Hatunla ne durumda onu tam olarak hatırlamamak beraber, parası bittiği için iş bulmaya gitti. Gittipi yerde tesadüfen bir iş veren ile karşılaştı. Onunla konuşup anlaştıktan sonra işi kabul etti. Kabul ettiği iş: Ütücülük anladığım kadarıyla. Çok zor koşullarda ve yoğun saatler boyunca çalışıyor. Bunun karşılığında yemek ve barınağı karşılanıyor ve ücret alıyor. Kendisi ilk başta bu işe başlarken bu işin kolay olacğaını zannediyordu. Her zamanki gibi 4-5 saat uyuyup kitap okuyabileceğine, kendine vakit ayırabileceğini düşünüyordu ama öyle olmadı. İş o kadar fazla ve ağırdı ki tek yaptığı çalışıp uyumak oldu. Kendi beklentilerimi, tahminlerimi de yazmak isterim buraya.\nMartin Eden bir otelde kazandairesinde ütü işinde çalışırken zamanla şunu anladı: Çalıştığı iş onu hayvana çdeviriyor ve içki içmesine vesile oluyordu. Çalışma koşulları o kadar ağırdı ki eskiden hissetiği tutkuları hissedemiyor, düşündüğü şeyleri düşünemiyor veya hayal edemiyordu. Kafasına bir ket vurulmuş gibiydi. Tek yaptığı çalışma arkadaşı ile birlikte bütün çalışmak. Buna rağmen sevgilisi Ruth’u görebilmek için bisikletle onca kilometre yolu bisikletiyle kattetiği oluyordu. Bu durum onu daha da yorgun yapsa da kendini inanılmaz çalışan süper bir makine haline getirdiği için çok sorun olmuyordu. Zaman ilerledikçe çalışma arkadaşı ile birlikte cumartesi günleri içki içmeye başladı. Aralarında geçen bir diyalog: Martin biliyor musun neden içiyorum, aslında ben içmek zorunda olduğum için içiyorum. O otelldeki insanları katletmemek için içiyorum. Onların tüm canlarınu bu içki bağışlıyor. Bu konuşmadan şunu anlıyorum: Çalışma koşulları o kadar ağır ve yaşadığı hayat o kadar sefil ki kaçabileceği, bu hayata devam etmesini sağlayabileceği tek kaçamak Alkol. Ayrıca çalışma arkadaşı köle olduğununda farkında ve bundan dolayı da istifa edip, sağda solda boş beleş bir şekilde takılıp içki içmek istiyor. Keza bunu önünde sonunda başarıyorda Martin sayesinde. Velhasılıkelam, bu süreç içerisinde Martin biraz daha olgunlaşıp, olan bitenlerin farkına varıyor. Yazdığı şiirlerin, denemelerin ve hikayelerin aslında o kadar da iyi olmadığını hatta kötü olduğunu fark ediyor. Kendi yazdıklarına bakıp sırıtıyor ve bunları yazarken aklımdan ne geçmiş diye gülümseyerek sorguluyordu. Çünkü o da fark etmişti sonunda ne kadar toy, ne kadar körpe olduğunu. Bu olayların sonunda da tabi istifayı basıyorlar. Martin tekrardan denize açılacak, çalışma arkadaşı ise aylaklık yapmaya yeni hayatına başlayacak.\nMartin Eden işten ayrıldıktan sonra Ruth ile birlikte vakit geçirmeye başladı. Kıza hala aşıktı ve aşkı her geçen gün daha da artıyordu. Birlikte kitap, şiir okuyorlar, vakit geçiriyorlar. Bu esnada Ruth sonunda annesiyle Martin hakkında konuşur ve aralarında benim için çok ilginç bir diyalog geçiyor. Ruth, Martin Eden’a aşık olmadığını söylüyor. Ona sahip olduğunu, bir bulldog köpeği olarak gördüğünü söylüyor. Onu eğitmeye, adam etmeye çalışıyor kendi standartlarına, düşüncelerine göre ama ona hiçbir sevgi veya aşk beslemiyor. Bende bu durumu alçaklık olarak değerlendiriyorum. Çünkü karşında sana aşık olduğunu bildiğin bir adam var ve biliyorsun ki onunla vakit geçirdikçe sana daha da bağlancak. Sonunda da acı gerçekle ile yanıp kavrulacak. Neyse, bu esnada annesiyle konuşurken de şunu öğreniyoruz aslında bunların hepsi planlı bir durummuş. Anne ve babası Ruth kadın olabilsin diye bunları tezgahlamış. Bir erkek buna aşık olsun bir şeyler hissetsin ki kadın olsun diye Martin Eden’ı, bizim elemanı kurban seçmişler. Birde komple aile şuna bakıyor, bu eleman bizim statümüze uygun değil, maaşı yok, işi yok, elit değil vs. caz yapıyorlar. Merak ediyorum ama bakalım bizim eleman ne yapacak. Kızı da tatile halasına mı, akrabasına mı bir yere gönderiyorlar. Orada kalacakmış. Geldiğinde de Martin Eden, Ruth’u göremeyince de aşkından vazgeçecekmiş güya. Hadi bakalım görelim ne olacak!\nAradan o kadar zaman geçti ve sayfa okudum ki hangi birini anlatsam bilemedim şu an. Martin git gide olgunlaşıp yazarlık hayatının gerçekleriyle yüzleşiyor aynı zamanda gerçek bilgeliğe yakınlaşıyor ve gerçek bilgileğin peşinde koşan insalarla tanışmaya başlıyor. Kitap gerçekten sınıf farkını gözler önüne serse de benim nezdimde hala bitirici vuruşu yapabilmiş değil. Güzel tespitler ve düşünceler olsa da sosyolojik veyahut demografik bir tespitte bulunduğu göremedim. Belki de ben yakalayamamışımdır. Velhasılıkelam, …\nUzun bir aradan sonra 1,5 bölüm okudum. Tabi uzun bir ara vermek demek kitap hakkında birçok bilgiyi, hissiyatı, atmosferi, karakterleri ve en önemlisi olayları unutmak oluyor maalesef. Anladığım kadarıyla Martin sevgilisinin ailesinin dave etmiş olduğu yemeğe gidiyor orada ailesiyle, ailesinin dostlarıyla birlikte muhabbet ediyor. Bu esnada zaten asıl olaylar gelişmeye başlıyor. Martin önceden yarı tanrı motifine koyduğu insanların ne kadar cahil, ne kadar basma kalıp sözlerle konuştuklarına ve daha da önemlisi kendi egolarını tatmin etmek dışında pek bir şey yapmadıklarına şahit olunca kendisini tutamıyor ve fikir münakaşasına başlıyor. Bu münakaşa çok hararetleniyor ve Martin çileden çıkıyor. Önüne gelen saydırıyor reis! Burada çıkarılacak ana argüman: Varlıklı, mevki-makam sahibi insanların halk tarafından düşünüldüğü gibi entellektüel, aydın kişiler değil bildiğimiz yarı cahil, eksik bilgilerle dolu, basma-kalıp fikirlerle hareket eden ve egosunu tatmin etmeye çalışan insanların olduğudur.\nBir diğer bölümde çok fazla bir şey olmuyor. Martin reis işçilerin fikirlerini tartıştığı, münazarada bulunduğu mekanda esip gürlüyor. Sonrasında da bir gazeteci bunu inanılmaz derece yazıp köşeye yada habere döşüyor. Buradan benim çıkardığım nüans şu: Gazetecilik …\nQuotes §\n\nTüm çocukluğu ve gençliği boyunca tanımlayamadığı bir tür huzursuzluk içinde yaşamış ve Ruth’ la karşılaşana kadar bir şey istediğini bilmekle birlikte, ne istediğini kestiremeyen ama yine de aramaya devam eden bir insanin çaresizliği yaşamıştı. Simdi ise bu huzursuzluğu daha da artmış ve ona daha fazla acı verir olmuştu, çünkü artık nihayet sahip olması gereken seylerin güzellik, bilgi ve ask oldugunu açık seçik ve kesin olarak anlamıştı.\n\n\nNeler düşündüklerini, hissetiklerini ve gördüklerini ifade etmeyi bilen insanlardı onlar. Güneşin altında uyuyan köpekler, sık sık inleyip havlarlardı, ama inlemelerine ya da havlamalarına neden olan şeyi söyleyemezlerdi. Martin de bu seyin ne oldugunu hep merak ediyordu. Simdi anlıyordu ki, kendisi de aynen öyleydi, güneşin altında uyuyan bir köpekti o da… Çok soylu ve güzel seyler hayal edebiliyordu ama sadece Ruth’ a sızlanabiliyordu ve sadece ona havlayabiliyordu.\n\n\nRuth sonunda diploma aldığı üniversitede bu konunun dersini görmüştü, ama özgün ve yaratıcı biri değildi; sahip olduğu kültürün bütün dışavurumları, başkalarınca dile getirilen şeylerin kulaktan dolma tekrarlarından ibaretti.\n\n\nGeçmişi olmayan; geleceği önündeki mezardan, bugünüyse içideki canhıraş hayat ateşinden ibaret bir adamdı.\n\n\n“Yazamayanlar, yazanlar hakkıdna çok şey yazıyor.”\n\n\nOnların görüşüne göre, Martin’in durumunda, en doğru hareket bir işe girmekti.

It’s a continuesly cycle which has dead line. The team all the time in communacation with daily, weekly meetings. Team make an analysis the scrum end of the period. As a result, It’s also a continuesly learning process for the team.\n\nMemebers of Scrum Team §\nScrum teams taking shape with 3 main part:\n\nProduct Owner: He/She is the bridge between business unit, customer and marketing needs.\nThe Scrum Master / Coach: It’s goal is increasing or stabilize the efficieny in scrum and team. He/She coaches to team.\nDevelopment Team: The workers, labours and also shot caller for backlogs’ deadline and velocities.\n\nScrum Artifacts §\nThose are important information used by the scrum team that helps define the product and what work to be done to create the product. There are 3 artifacts in scrum:\n\nProduct Backlog: The demand or jobs which has to be done. It  created by Product Owner or Product Manager.\nSprint Backlog: Selected demands, jobs, to-dos’ for the during scrum sprint. It selected begining of sprint on ‘Sprint Planning’ meeting.\nIncrement: Definition of ‘Done’ and sprint goals. Teams may use different word to descripe to ‘Done’\n\nScrum Ceremonies / Events §\nScrum is continuesly cycle which has a deadline. As a result, there are routine meetings, practices and ceremonies. Those are:\n\nOrganize the Backlog\nSprint Planning\nSprint\nDaily Scrum / Stand Up (Daily Meetings)\nSprint Review\nSprint Retrospective\n\nSprints §\nSprints are periods which have end date to deliver product/software packages. Team choose issues before start Sprints. After that, issues tried to completed in sprints. Sprint duration may change based on project or manager.\nSprint Planning §\nBefore start to sprint, team has to decide what are they going to do, and how are going to achieve their goals.\n\nThe What: The PO - Product Owner sets the goal for that sprint and the team argues how can they achieve the goal.\nThe How: Developers decides to the path goings to the goal while being touch with PO - Product Owner.\nThe Who: PO - Product Owner and development team has to attend Sprint Planning meetings. Otherwise, it’s impossible to start sprint because PO - Product Owner will decide the goal and development team argue that is it possible to achieve this goal or how can we do it.\nThe Inputs: What is the difference between ‘The What’ &amp; ‘The Inputs’? I didn’t understand this part.\nThe Outputs: Announcing the goals, backlogs and describing how it will work done.\n\n\nSprint planning needs to estimate based on technic knowledge and experience. It should be clarified which backlogs/inputs can be done or not in time.\n\nScrum is a process framework aimed at solving complex problems. Complex problems require an empirical process (learning by doing). Empirical processes are very hard to plan, so don’t kid yourself—you can’t build the perfect plan.\n\nCeremonies §\nThose ceremonies build up the skeleton of Scrum. Team members, PO - Product Owner, etc. gets update and feedback instantly with daily meeting, weekly meeting etc. The main point is that being in communicate instantly. Several ceremonies like those:\nSprint Planning §\nPlaning which product, request will delivered in this sprint.\n\nAttendees: Development team, Scrum Master, PO - Product Owner\nWhen: At the beginning of a sprint.\nAgile framework: Scrum\nPurpose: Making clear items of work and deciding the path which carry to success.\n\nDaily Stand-Up §\nAs known as ‘Daily Scrum’ is a short, 15-20 minute (or less) daily meetings.\n\nAttendees: Development team, Scrum Master, PO - Product Owner\nWhen: Everyday\nDuration: 15-20 minute\nPurpose: To inform everyone, what’s going on. Also, getting feedback that is there any problem. Therefore, meeting cover up with these 3 questions:\n\nWhat did I complete yesterday?\nAm I blocked by anything?\nWhat will I work on today?\n\n\n\nSprint Review §\nThe ‘Sprint Review’ also called an ‘Iteration Review’. In Sprint review meetings, talks about what we have done or what we couldn’t done also team members share their feedbacks, experience which they gained during current sprint.\n\nAttendees: Development team, scrum master, product owner.\nWhen: At the end of sprint.\nDuration: 45 minutes per week of iteration.\nAgile Framework: Scrum &amp; Kanban\nPurpose: It’s showcase your products to stakeholders. Getting mutual feedbacks during meetings.\n\nSprint Retrospective §\nSprint Retrospective meetings include team members not stakeholders like ‘Sprint Review’. Team analyze their-self, their performance and problems which come up during sprint. They focus on what can we do it better, what can we improve.\n\nAttendees: Development team, scrum master, product owner.\nWhen: At the end of sprint.\nDuration: 90 minutes per week of iteration.\nAgile Framework: Scrum &amp; Kanban\nPurpose: Learn to what worked well and what didn’t during sprint.\n\nBacklogs §\nBacklogs are list of works. It prepares by PO - Product Owner or business units. Backlogs come from customer, request and demands. Backlogs doesn’t push to developers, developers pick backlogs.\nStart with The Two “R”s §\nA team’s ‘roadmap’ and ‘requirements’ provide the foundation for the product backlog.\n\nRoadmap\n\nEpics\n\nRequirements &amp; User Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSprint Reviews §\nSprint reviews are the answer of what we have done, what was the strength and weak sides. It has not to be formal meetings. Only team members attend those meetings usually.\nDefinition of Done (DoD) §\nIt should clarified that when we can put an issue card to ‘Done’ columns. It helps to avoid miss understands and unfinished issues.\nCulture of Delivery §\nSuccessful teams clarified process, develop steps in each work items to prevent delivering miss or incorrect packages based on those questions:\n\nDid issues, stories well-written by the team before implementation?\nDoes everyone knows team’ engineering values and culture?\nDoes everyone commitment about develop process?\n\nStand-ups §\nStand-ups as known as ‘Daily Scrums’ too. It is a short daily meeting talks everyone about:\n\nWhat did I done yesterday?\nIs there are any impediment which blocks to move?\nWhat will I do today?\n\nScrum Master §\nScrum master is play maker of Scrum. Scrum master aim those:\n\nIncrease of efficiency of Scrum\nCreate rules based on project or specific needs which adapting the firm culture, vision.\nSolving impediment issues\n\nScrum master can’t always follow the books, standart techniques. Every project, firm may have different needs and culture. Scrum master needs to adapt those and change the games rule with maximizing efficiency. !\n\nResponsibilities of Scrum Master §\n\nStand-ups: Arranging daily meetings.\nIteration / Sprint Planning Meetings: Protect the team to overload\nSprint Reviews: Catching feedbacks in meeting.\nRetrospectives: Taking notes to improve team capabilities, abilities, etc. for the future.\nBoard Administration\n1 on 1s\nInternal Consulting\nReporting\nBlockers\n\nRetrospective Meetings §\nRetrospectives are great opportunities to identify which sides are can improve and learn mistakes happened during sprint. It helps to build a continuous improvement cycle.\nPurposes:\n\nClarified block issues, mistakes and weak sides of the sprint.\nCreate opportunities for strength sides.\nGain experience by the sprint\nGet feedback, comments about sprint, team and project.\n\nIt’s a great chance to tell your opinions about sprint, team, etc. because only attends to team members. You don’t need worry about consumers, big bosses.\n\nThe When: End of sprint.\nThe Who: All team members.\n\nRoles §\nDevelopment Team §\nDevelopment teams as known as ‘Developers’ are main labor force of team. They are responsible for delivering the work in time.\n\nProduct Owner (PO) §\nProduct owner (PO) is a bridge between customer/business requirements and the team. PO gets directions, needs, desires from customer or business units. After that, PO analyzes requirements based on the team’s then decided to backlogs, packages.\nResponsible\n\nThe scrum backlog\nRelease Management\nStakeholder Management\n\n\nScrum Master §\nMain responsible of scrum master is hold together everything in stabil. Scrum master helps to achieve goals and show the path to teams.\nResponsible\n\nTransparency\nEmpiricism\nValues (Courage, focus, commitment, respect and openness)\n\n\nSoS (Scrum of Scrum) §\nHistory\n\nThe Scrum of Scrums methodology was first implemented in 1996 by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, two pioneers of the Scrum framework.\n\nSoS (Scrum of Scrums) is a technique to connect several teams into scrum. It makes possible to deliver big and complex projects.\n\nScrum Metrics §\nScrum metrics are visual monitors to analyze the team performance. It helps to discover of bottlenecks. Therefore, teams can perform their-self and increase their efficiency and improve them capabilities. Also, scrum metrics allows to make decisions based on data. As a result, managers, teams make their decisions with logic.\n\nROI (Return on Investment)\nCustomer satisfaction\nTeam Satisfaction\n\nTeam Velocity §\nTeam velocity graphs represent team’s delivered work of items in sprint. That makes to calculate that how much backlogs the team can handle. As a result, teams’ volumes become predictable. Also, it can watch is there something unusual about teams’ performance.\n\nBurn-down Chart §"},"2.-📝-Literature/BUS-231---W2":{"title":"BUS 231 - W2","links":["2.-📝-Literature/BUS-231---W2","tags/literature","tags/edu","tags/marketing"],"tags":["literature","edu","marketing"],"content":"BUS 231 - W2 §\n#literature,#edu ,#marketing\nWhat is Marketing? §\nMarketing is not just selling products anymore in this century.

They include:\n\nMean\nMedian\nMode\n\n\nThe Mean §\nThe means as known as average of the observations.\nThere is a distinguish between Population Mean &amp; Sample Mean:\n\nThe problem with ‘The Mean’ is being sensitive on small setts. For example:\n\nSet 1: (2, 4, 6, 20) —&gt; The Mean: 32 / 4 = 8\nSet 2: (2, 4, 6, 100) —&gt; The Mean: 112 / 4 = 28\n\nAs it seen, in small samples / setts the mean may changed extremely. This situation goes us to ‘The Median’\nThe Median §\nThe median is the middle number in sett / sample when numbers ordered by ascending.\nExample\n\nSample: (12, 5, 7, 1, 25) —&gt; The Median: 7 —&gt; (1, 5, 7, 12, 25)\n\n\nThe Mode §\nThe mode tells us that which number in sample is repeated most.\n\n\n                  \n                  Tip \n                  \n                \nIf there are tie repeated numbers, then there is no mode.\n\n\nMeasure of Dispersion §\nMeasures of dispersion describe the spread of the data. The include:\n\nRange\nInter Quartile Range\nThe Standard Deviation &amp; Variance\n\nThe Range §\nThe range is the difference between smallest number and largest number in sample.\nTheRange=LargestNumber−SmallestNumber\nThe Inter Quartile Range §\nThe Interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the first quartile and the third quartile.\nIQR=Q3−Q1\nIQR helps not to effected by outliers. Outliers numbers may changes the result depends on differences between them. As a result, it avoid to see healthy predictions.\n\nThe Standart Deviation &amp; Variance §\nThese two metrics aims that how much far away values from median.

Worker has to pay attention to production process that means life-long learning process. A person can’t be good in every profession. Person has lack of knowledge or abilities on some areas. Therefore, producing a good was slow and hard in pre-industrialization era.\nIndustrial Management Philosophy §\n\n\nThe main concern is who is going to set the standards and the pace of the work.\n\n\nThe tenet is that pace of work determines the productivity of the work.\n\n\nEmerging management class needs to information as much as workers.\n\n\nKnowledge of production controls every steps in labor process.\n\n\nA new professions came up like supervisor, managers, etc. Those are control organization, workers.\n\n\nDirect producers became deskilled\n\n\nDirect producers lost their control on production process. They are stripped of knowledge of how production is organised.\n\n\nWhere Do We Come Here From? §\nThe answer is scientific management and mass production. Taylorism and Fordism opened of this road by:\n\nLow Skilled\nDisposable\nFragmented\nClosely Supervised\n\nAdvantages &amp; Drawbacks of Taylorism §\n\nTaylorism separate jobs to small parts to increase efficiency and speed up production process.\nTaylorism sees people as economical animal. They have value as much as machines.\nTaylorism focus on individual, not the big picture. While exploiting, it doesn’t care the result. It just care the profit and efficiency.\nSelf-sufficient company.\nArgues that increasing fragmentation of tasks proved to be conducive to efficient manufacturing of high volume - low cost products.\n\nCritical Approaches to Taylorism §\nBoth of them ignores the human and their emotions. They think people like a machine, or just motivating by money etc. Further that, people are emotional, social living creatures. Also, they took their skills. This scientific management make them de skilled.\nBraveman’s Critique of Taylorism §\nBravermann argues that capitalist organizes focus on minimizing cost and maximizing efficiency. Thus, people lost their control their skills, abilities on works and more the point is that they don’t have knowledge about assembly line, process of production. Workers deskilled in this times.\nFurther Problems with Scientific Management §\n\nEmployees don’t share the profit. They just get their salary.\nSpecialized jobs in mass production are became boring. They are doing only a few simple task in every day.\n\nAlienation §\nCapitalism doesn’t give autonomy to workers. On the other hand, capitalism limited workers’ right to speak about jobs. They became deskilled employees, they can fire easily and find another person instead of them. Thus, workers does not:\n\nOwn the means of production\nControl the process or the pace\nOwn the final product\nSet the organizational goals\nHave the right to make decisions\n\nThere are four aspect to alienation\nWorkers is alienated from:\n\nThe process of production\nThe object of labor\nOneself\nFellow human beings\n"}}
